## Introduction
Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of binary trees, including their properties, operations, and applications.

## Binary Tree Operations
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)
- Searching

## Algorithms
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Balancing algorithms (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Trees)

## Usage
To use the binary tree implementations and algorithms provided in this project, follow the instructions in the respective source files. Examples and test cases are included to demonstrate the functionality.
